# Seq.Input.MsSql

A Seq custom input that pulls messages from SQL tables. **Requires Seq 5.1+ and currently works only on Windows instances not on docker**

## Getting started

The app is published to NuGet as [_Seq.Input.MsSql_](https://nuget.org/packages/Seq.Input.MsSql). Follow the instructions for [installing a Seq App](https://docs.datalust.co/docs/installing-seq-apps) and start an instance of the app, providing your SQL details.

## Update notice

Update Seq.Input.MSSQL to provide structured properties for interoperability with other apps such as Seq.App.OpsGenie and Seq.App.Atlassian.Jira.
